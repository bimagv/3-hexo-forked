# Why Blogging
To create, organizing knowladge that very useful in future.

# More and more data
OneNote or P3X OneNote is one of the best notetaking application rich feature & modern UI. But, I need a blog!... to make it public. So, My friend know what I share in blog post.

>Is that cool?

Then Patrick says: *No, OneNote can do that because they are online! what the problem using this tool, ............*

Probably because they are spread on many place. It's often difficult for me to synchronize them and there is no way to 'freely' control with my workflow. 

Also I need lightweight application and more space for note collection.

Need moore space dude? Don't worry...

>because it's "in the cloud"

Then Patrick says: *There is no cloud! Its just someone else's computer* *fuarkkk

## Comfortable with archive based blog
When I create [bimagv.miraheze.org](https://bimagv.miraheze.org) I need to make note when offline, that troublesome too. 

lucky Static Site generator (SSG) can make a deal with them. And also *OneNote like* theme with 3-stage design, [hexo-theme-3](https://github.com/yelog/hexo-theme-3-hexo) 

Something cool I can do with ssg:

* [x] Notetaking when I'm offline with Vscode
* [x] I can easily writing with Open Source CMS, Forestry.io
* [x] I can use google analytics, so google can indexed my site
* [x] I can get a lot of modification with hacking the theme :v
* [x] It's time to start learn how to make a github pages, using pipelines, and many other to improve my knowledge that I want to share to you
